# Title
NWS Weather Alerts
# Description
This is a simple data fetch project.  It pulls data off the NWS (National Weather Servive) API server.  The output data is a JSON data set.  The query is configured to pull a single state or territory in US at a time.  At the top of the page, a select is used to chose the state.  When the states are changed, the warnings are also updated.  There are two files, _0 and _1.  _0 uses manualy entry and _1 allows for selection from a menu.
